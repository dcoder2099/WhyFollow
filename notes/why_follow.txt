I'm following 600 people right now...

And sometimes I go look back through that and I see somebody and say, "Why
am I following this person?"

There WAS a reason.

Add a note to say, "Here's why I follow this person."

Then allow it to be public (or private).

realtime filling in of why someone's being followed.

Share across all users and have a search for discovering people 
to follow based on similar reasons...

And after aggregating all that, you can provide a search across all those
people.

Social graph, "second stage" feasibility

Lists on steroids.

Having a note field lowers the barrier to creating lists... I can annotate
these people as I find them and then as a possible future-feature, be able
to pull all those together to build my list.
